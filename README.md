I did research about the Boston Housing Data. I visualized the data using histograms of the different variables in the data set,
transformed the data into a binary incidence matrix, visualized the data using the itemFrequencyPlot and did the recommendation for a low crime area as close to the city as possible and low pupil-teacher ratios areas.
